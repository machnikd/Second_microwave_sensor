# Second_microwave_sensor
"This is a project I am currently working on as part of my master's thesis. The sensor is designed to measure the electrical permittivity of objects passing through it, which allows, for example, the measurement of the moisture content of rapeseed grains â€” this will be its main application."

## Project Report - The full project report will be created after the initial tests are completed.

## Project description and objectives

### Project goal
Rapeseed moisture content is one of the key physicochemical parameters of the seeds, because of its importance for ensuring optimal conditions for seed storage, as well as for determining the time of harvesting.  Measurement techniques usually use a large sample of seeds (in the case of capacitance meters e.g., 100 g). Therefore, the obtained result is an average value representative for the tested sample, but does not give the range of moisture of single seeds in a given batch of material.The system utilizes multiple measurements of a complex reflection coefficient that correspond to different positions and orientations of a seed under test along the sensor.
